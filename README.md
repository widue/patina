## Why Patina

- Records foreground apps automatically, without manually starting or stopping timers.
- Handles idle, lock, sleep, and abnormal-exit boundaries to keep records more trustworthy.
- Keeps data local by default, with no account, cloud sync, or server dependency.
- Lets you manage app names, categories, colors, stats exclusions, and window title capture.
- Provides lightweight local tools such as reminders, timers, and Pomodoro.
- Keeps the interface restrained, clear, and low-interruption for long-term daily use.

## Download

Prebuilt versions are published on GitHub Releases:

- [Download latest](https://github.com/Ceceliaee/patina/releases/latest)

Open the release page, download the Windows installer, and run it. Patina currently targets Windows 10/11 desktop use.

The Patina Web Sync browser extension is optional and is used to identify webpage titles in browsers.

## Core Features

### Automatic Tracking

- Automatically records the current foreground app and turns activity into time records.
- Detects idle, lock, and sleep states to reduce invalid time in statistics.
- Handles record boundaries after long-away periods and abnormal exits, reducing accidentally merged time.
- Reduces missed effective activity in low-interaction scenarios such as videos, meetings, courses, and livestreams.

### Review And Analysis

- Review effective activity, app rankings, and category distribution in today's overview.
- Use the timeline to review activity by date and inspect app switches and window title details.
- Understand long-term time distribution through trends, heatmaps, and app curves.

### Management And Control

- Rename apps and adjust categories, colors, and statistics rules.
- Exclude apps you do not want in statistics, or disable window title capture for specific apps.
- Export local backups, restore backups, and clean up historical records.

### Lightweight Tools

- Create one-off reminders and app usage limit reminders.
- Use stopwatch, countdown, and Pomodoro for active focus tasks.
- Tool state stays local and does not replace automatic tracking records.

## Reliability And Privacy

Time tracking has long-term value only when the records are trustworthy. Patina focuses on these boundaries:

- **Foreground app recognition**: records the window and app that are actually in the foreground, reducing temporary-window and system noise.
- **Idle handling**: idle time does not continue counting as effective activity.
- **State boundaries**: handles record boundaries after lock, sleep, resume, long-away periods, and abnormal exits.
- **Effective-duration stats**: rankings, distributions, and totals use effective activity time, not just open spans.
- **Title capture control**: window title capture can be disabled per app to reduce unnecessary sensitive information retention.
- **Local data control**: core data stays local, and backups, restores, and history cleanup are initiated by the user.

## Current Scope

Patina currently focuses on personal local time records:

- Windows 10/11 desktop use
- Personal local data storage and control
- Automatic tracking, review, classification, and backup or restore
- Lightweight local tools

It is not currently aimed at team collaboration, account systems, cloud sync, multi-platform sync, or heavy AI insights.
